## Backbone-relational
Backbone-relational provides one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-one relations between models for [Backbone](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone). To use relations, extend `Backbone.RelationalModel` (instead of the regular `Backbone.Model`) and define a property `relations`, containing an array of option objects. Each relation must define (as a minimum) the `type`, 'key' and 'relatedModel'. Available relation types are `Backbone.HasOne` and `Backbone.HasMany`.

* Bi-directional relations automatically notify related models of changes
* Decide how relations are serialized using the `includeInJSON` option (just id, or the full set of attributes, in which case the relations of this object are in turn serialized as well)
* Convert nested objects in a model's attributes into Models when using the `createModels` option upon initialization

### Example:

	paul = new Person({
		id: 'person-1',
		name: 'Paul',
		user: { id: 'user-1', login: 'dude', email: 'me@gmail.com' }
	});
	
	ourHouse = new House({
		id: 'house-1',
		location: 'in the middle of the street',
		occupants: ['person-1']
	});
	
	paul.get('user').get('login'); // 'dude'
	
	paul.get('livesIn'); // a ref to 'ourHouse', which is automatically defined because of the bi-directional HasMany relation on House to Person
	
	paul.get('user').toJSON();
	/*
		{
			email: 'me@gmail.com',
			id: 'user-1',
			login: 'dude',
			person: {
				id: 'person-1',
				name: 'Paul',
				livesIn: {
					id: "house-1",	
					location: "in the middle of the street",
					occupants: ["person-1"]
				},
				user: 'user-1'
			}
		}
	*/
	
	ourHouse.get('occupants').remove( paul.id ); // we just made paul homeless..
	
	paul.get('livesIn'); // see? 'null'.

	
This required the following relations and models:


	House = Backbone.RelationalModel.extend({
		// The `relations` property, on the House's prototype. Initialized separately for each instance of House.
		// Each relation must define (as a minimum) the 'type', 'key' and 'relatedModel'. Options are
		// `includeInJSON`, `createModels` and `reverseRelation`, which takes the same options as the relation itself.
		relations: [
			{
				type: Backbone.HasMany, // Use the type, or the string 'HasOne' or 'HasMany'.
				key: 'occupants',
				relatedModel: 'Person',
				includeInJSON: false,
				reverseRelation: {
					key: 'livesIn'
				}
			}
		]
	});
	
	Person = Backbone.RelationalModel.extend({
		relations: [
			{ // Create a (recursive) one-to-one relationship
				type: Backbone.HasOne,
				key: 'user',
				relatedModel: 'User',
				reverseRelation: {
					type: Backbone.HasOne,
					key: 'person'
				}
			}
		],
		
		initialize: function() {
			// do whatever you want :)
		}
	});
	
	User = Backbone.RelationalModel.extend();

### How it works

Each Backbone.RelationalModel registers itself with Backbone.Store upon creation (and removes itself from the Store when destroyed). When creating or updating an attribute that is a key in a relation, removed related objects are notified of their removal, and new related objects are looked up in the Store.
